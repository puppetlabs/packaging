#Packaging

This is a repository for packaging automation for Puppet Labs software.
The goal is to abstract and automate packaging processes beyond individual
software projects to a level where this repo can be cloned inside any project
and used to build Debian and Redhat packages, as well as gems, apple packages
and tarballs. This repo is currently under heavy development and in a state
flux, and it should not be considered to have a formal API. However, every
effort is being made to ensure existing tasks/behavior are not broken as we
continue to iterate and improve upon it.

##Using the Packaging Repo

Several Puppet Labs projects are using the packaging repo. They are:

* puppet
* facter
* puppet-dashboard
* hiera
* puppetdb
* razor

as well as several closed-source projects, including
* live-management
* console-auth
* console

Generally speaking, the packaging repo should be compatible with ruby 1.8.7,
ruby 1.9.3 and rake 0.9.x. To pull the packaging tasks into your source repo,
do a `rake package:bootstrap`. This will clone this repo into the ext directory
of the project and make many packaging tasks available. The tasks are
generally grouped into two categories, `package:` namespaced tasks and `pl:`
namespaced tasks.

## `package:` tasks
`package:` namespaced tasks are general purpose tasks that are set up to use
the most minimal tool chain possible for creating packages. These tasks will
create rpms and debs, but any build dependencies will need to be satisifed by
the building host, and any dynamically generated dependencies may result in
packages that are only suitable for the OS/version of the build host. However,
for rolling one's own debs and rpms or for use in environments without many
OSes/versions, this may work just fine. To build an rpm using the packaging
repo, do a `rake package:rpm`. To build a deb, use `rake package:deb`.

## `pl:` tasks
`pl:` namespaced tasks rely on a slighly more complex toolchain for packaging
inside clean chroot environments for the various operating systems and versions
that Puppet Labs supports. On the rpm side, this is done with
[mock](http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Projects/Mock) and for debs, we use
pdebuild and [cowbuilder](http://wiki.debian.org/cowbuilder). For the most
part, these tasks are keyed to puppetlabs infrastructure, and are used by the
Release Engineering team to create release packages. However, they can
certainly be modified to suit other environments, and much effort went into
making tasks as modular and reusable as possible. Several Puppet Labs-specific
tasks are only available if the file '~/.packaging' is present.  This file is
created by the `pl:fetch` task, which curls two yaml files into 'team' and
'project' subdirectories.  from a [separate build data
repository](https://github.com/puppetlabs/build-data), which contains
additional settings/data specific to Puppet Labs release infrastructure. The
goal in separating these data and tasks out is to refrain from presenting by
default yet more Puppet Labs-specific tasks that aren't generally consumable by
everyone. To build a deb from a local repository using a `pl` task, ssh into a
builder (e.g., one stood up using the modules detailed below) and clone the
source repo, e.g. puppet. Then, run `rake package:bootstrap` and `rake pl:deb`
to create a deb, and `rake pl:mock` to make an rpm (on a debian or redhat host,
respectively).

## `pe:` tasks There is also a `pe:` namespace, for the building of Puppet
Labs' Puppet Enterprise packages that have been converted to using this repo.
The `pe:` tasks rely heavily on PL internal infrastructure, and are not
generally useful outside of this environment. To create packages, in the source
repository run `rake package:bootstrap`, followed by `rake pl:fetch`. These two
commands bootstrap the packaging environment and pull in the additional data
needed for PE building (see `pl:fetch` notes above).  Then, to make a debian
package, run `rake pe:deb`, and to make an rpm, run `rake pe:mock`. There are
also `pe:deb_all` and `pe:mock_all` tasks, which build packages against all
shipped debian/redhat targets. The `pe:deb_all` task is not generally necessary
for developer use for building test packages; the `pe:deb` task creates a
  package that will work against virtually all supported PE debian versions.
  The same is generally true for PE internal rpms, but because of variances in
  build macros for rpm, rpms should generally be built with `pe:mock_all`, and
  then the desired version installed, or by building only for a specific
  target.  This is accomplished by passing MOCK=<mock> to the rake call, e.g.
  `rake pe:mock MOCK=<mock>`.  The available mocks are listed in
  `ext/build_defaults.yaml` after `final_mocks:`.  For PE, the mocks are
  formatted as `pupent-<peversion>-<distversion>-<arch>`, e.g.
  `pupent-2.7-el5-i386`. To build for a specific target, set `MOCK=<mock>` to
  the mock that matches the target. The `pe:deb` and `pe:mock` tasks work by
  using the `:remote` tasks for building on a remote builder using the current
  committed state of the source repository. To forego remote building and build
  on the local station (e.g., by ssh-ing into a remote builder first), the
  tasks `pe:local_mock` and `pe:local_deb` build using the local host.

## `:remote:` tasks There are also sub-namespaces of `:pl` and `:pe` that are
worth noting. First, the `:remote` namespace. Tasks under `:remote` perform
builds remotely on internal builders from your local workstation. How they
work:

1) Run `pl:fetch` to obtain extra data from the build-data repo. The data
includes the hostnames of builders to use for packaging.

2) Create a git bundle of the local workspace and tar it up.

3) Create a build parameters file. The params file includes all the information
about the build, including any values overridden with env vars, and the actual
task to run, e.g. `rake pl:deb`.

4) scp the git bundle and build parameters file to a temporary directory on the
builder hostname assigned to that particular package build type.

5) ssh into the builder, untar the git bundle, clone it, and run `rake
package:bootstrap`.

6) ssh into the builder, cd into the cloned repo, and run `rake
pl:build_from_params PARAMS_FILE=/path/to/previously/sent/file`.

7) Maintain the ssh connection until the build finishes, and rsync the packages
from the builder to the local workstation.

## `:jenkins:` tasks Jenkins tasks are similar to the `:remote:` tasks, but
they do not require ssh access to the builders.  The jenkins tasks enable the
packaging repo to kick off packaging builds on a remote jenkins slave. They
work in a similar way to the :remote tasks, but with a few key differences. The
jenkins tasks transmit information to a jenkins coordinator, which handles the
rest. The data passed are the following:

1) $PROJECT\_BUNDLE - a tar.gz of a git-bundle from HEAD of the current
project, which is cloned on the builder to set up a duplicate of this
environment

2) $BUILD\_PROPERTIES - a build parameters file, containing all information
about the build

3) $BUILD\_TYPE - the "type" of build, e.g. rpm, deb, gem, etc The jenkins url
and job name are obtained via the team build-data file from [the build data
repository](https://github.com/puppetlabs/build-data)

4) $PROJECT - the project we're building, e.g. facter, puppet. This is used
later in determining the target for the build artifacts on the distribution
server

5) $DOWNSTREAM\_JOB - The URL of a downstream job that jenkins should post to
upon success. This is obtained via the DOWNSTREAM\_JOB environment variable.


On the Jenkins end, the job is a parameterized job that accepts five
parameters. Jenkins has the Parameterized Trigger Plugin, Workspace Cleanup
Plugin, and Node and Label Parameter Plugin in use for this job. The workspace
cleanup plugin cleans the workspace before each build. Two are file parameters,
two string parameters, and a Label parameter provided by the Node and Label
Parameter Plugin, as described above. When the pl:jenkins:\* task triggers a
build, it passes values for all of these parameters. The Label parameter is
associated with the build type. This way we can queue the job on a builder with
the appropriate capabilities just by assigning a builder the label "deb" or
"rpm," etc. The actual build itself is accomplished via a shell build task. The
contents of the task are:

```bash
#################

  SHA=$(echo $BUILD_PROPERTIES | cut -d '.' -f1)

  echo "Build type: $BUILD_TYPE"

 ### Create a local clone of the git-bundle that was passed
 # The bundle is a tarball, and since this is a project-agnostic
 # job, we don't actually know what's in it, just that it's a
 # git bundle.


  [ -f "PROJECT_BUNDLE" ] || exit 1
  mkdir project && tar -xzf PROJECT_BUNDLE -C project/

  cd project
    git clone --recursive $(ls) git_repo

    cd git_repo

      ### Clone the packaging repo
      rake package:bootstrap && rake pl:fetch

      ### Perform the build
      rake pl:load_extras pl:build_from_params PARAMS_FILE=$WORKSPACE/BUILD_PROPERTIES

      ### Send the results
      rake pl:jenkins:ship["artifacts"]

      ### If a downstream job was passed, trigger it now
      if [ -n "$DOWNSTREAM_JOB" ] ; then
        rake pl:jenkins:post["$DOWNSTREAM_JOB"]
      fi

## Modules

A puppet module,
[puppetlabs-debbuilder](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-debbuilder),
has been created to stand up a debian build host compatible with the debian
side of this packaging repo. The rpm-side module,
[puppetlabs-rpmbuilder](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-rpmbuilder),
will set up an rpm builder.

## Clean up
To remove the packaging repo, remove the ext/packaging directory or run `rake
package:implode`.

##Setting up projects for the Packaging Repo

The packaging repo requires many project-side artifacts inside the ext
directory at the top level. [facter](https://github.com:puppetlabs/facter) and
[hiera](https://github.com:puppetlabs/hiera) are good examples.
It expects the following directory structure in the project

*   ext/{debian,redhat,osx}

each of which contains templated erb files using the instance variables
specified in the setupvars task. These include a debian changelog, a redhat
spec file, and an osx preflight and plist.

The top level Rakefile or a separate task file in the project should have the following added:

```ruby
Dir['ext/packaging/tasks/**/*.rake'].sort.each { |t| load t }

build_defs_file = 'ext/build_defaults.yaml'
if File.exist?(build_defs_file)
  begin
    require 'yaml'
    @build_defaults ||= YAML.load_file(build_defs_file)
  rescue Exception => e
    STDERR.puts "Unable to load yaml from #{build_defs_file}:"
    STDERR.puts e
  end
  @packaging_url  = @build_defaults['packaging_url']
  @packaging_repo = @build_defaults['packaging_repo']
  raise "Could not find packaging url in #{build_defs_file}" if @packaging_url.nil?
  raise "Could not find packaging repo in #{build_defs_file}" if @packaging_repo.nil?

  namespace :package do
    desc "Bootstrap packaging automation, e.g. clone into packaging repo"
    task :bootstrap do
      if File.exist?("ext/#{@packaging_repo}")
        puts "It looks like you already have ext/#{@packaging_repo}. If you don't like it, blow it away with package:implode."
      else
        cd 'ext' do
          %x{git clone #{@packaging_url}}
        end
      end
    end
    desc "Remove all cloned packaging automation"
    task :implode do
      rm_rf "ext/#{@packaging_repo}"
    end
  end
end
```

Also in ext should be two files, build_defaults.yaml and project_data.yaml.

This is the sample build_defaults.yaml file from Hiera:
```yaml

For basic mac packaging, add an osx directory in ext containing the following files:
1. a preflight.erb template for any pre-flight actions, perhaps removing the old package if present.
2. a prototype.plist.erb that is templated into the pkginfo.plist file for the package. This is the one from puppet. Note that these variable names aren't mutable here, but there's no need to worry about their value assignment, it's done in the apple task:
```

A file_mapping.yaml file that specifies a set of files and a set of directories
from the source to install, with destinations, ownership, and permissions. The
directories are top level directories in the source to install. The files are
files somewhere in the source to install. This is the one from puppet 3.x:
```yaml
---
directories:
# this will take the contents of lib, e.g. puppet/lib/\* and place them in
# /usr/lib/ruby/site\_ruby/1.8
  lib:
    path: 'usr/lib/ruby/site_ruby/1.8'
    owner: 'root'
    group: 'wheel'
    perms: '0644'
  bin:
    path: 'usr/bin'
    owner: 'root'
    group: 'wheel'
    perms: '0755'
  'man/man8':
    path: 'usr/share/man/man8'
    owner: 'root'
    group: 'wheel'
    perms: '0755'
files:
# this will take the file puppet/conf/auth.conf and place it in
# /private/etc/puppet/, creating the directory if not present
  'conf/auth.conf':
