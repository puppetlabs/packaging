    # Please Note:
    # We are currently adding two signatures to the msi.
    #
    # Microsoft compatable Signatures are composed of three different
    # elements.
    #   1) The Certificate used to sign the package. This is the element that
    #     is attached to organization. The certificate has an associated
    #     algorithm. We recently (February 2016) had to switch from a sha1 to
    #     a sha256 certificate. Sha1 was deprecated by many Microsoft
    #     elements on 2016-01-01, which forced us to switch to a sha256 cert.
    #     This sha256 certificate is recognized by all currently supported
    #     windows platforms (Windows 8/Vista forward).
    #   2) The signature used to attach the certificate to the package. This
    #     can be a done with a variety of digest algorithms. Older platforms
    #     (i.e., Windows 8 and Windows Vista) don't recognize later
    #     algorithms like sha256.
    #   3) The timestamp used to validate when the package was signed. This
    #     comes from an external source and can be delivered with a variety
    #     of digest algorithms. Older platforms do not recognize newer
    #     algorithms like sha256.
    #
    # We could have only one signature with the Sha256 Cert, Sha1 Signature,
    # and Sha1 Timestamp, but that would be too easy. The sha256 signature
    # and timestamp add more security to our packages. We can't have only
    # sha256 elements in our package signature, though, because Windows 8
    # and Windows Vista just don't recognize them at all.
    #
    # In order to add two signatures to an MSI, we also need to change the
    # tool we use to sign packages with. Previously, we were using SignTool
    # which is the Microsoft blessed program used to sign packages. However,
    # this tool isn't able to add two signatures to an MSI specifically. It
    # can dual-sign an exe, just not an MSI. In order to get the dual-signed
    # packages, we decided to switch over to using osslsigncode. The original
    # project didn't have support to compile on a windows system, so we
    # decided to use this fork. The binaries on the signer were pulled from
    # https://sourceforge.net/u/keeely/osslsigncode/ci/master/tree/
    #
    # These are our signatures:
    # The first signature:
    #   * Sha256 Certificate
    #   * Sha1 Signature
    #   * Sha1 Timestamp
    #
    # The second signature:
    #   * Sha256 Certificate
    #   * Sha256 Signature
    #   * Sha256 Timestamp
    #
    # Once we no longer support Windows 8/Windows Vista, we can remove the
    # first Sha1 signature.
