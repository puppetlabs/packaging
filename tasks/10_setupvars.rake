# of this inside a build object, that information is no longer available. This
# section is for backwards compatibility only. It sets an instance variable
# for all of the parameters inside the build object. This is repeated in
# 20_setupextrasvars.rake. Note: The intention is to eventually abolish this
# behavior. We want to access information from the build object, not in what
# are essentially globally available rake variables.
