# The jenkins tasks enable the packaging repo to kick off packaging builds on a
# remote jenkins slave. They work in a similar way to the :remote tasks, but
# with a few key differences. The jenkins tasks transmit information to a
# jenkins coordinator, which handles the rest. The data passed are the
# following:
#
# 1) $PROJECT_BUNDLE - a tar.gz of a git-bundle from HEAD of the current
#    project, which is cloned on the builder to set up a duplicate of this
#    environment
#
# 2) $BUILD_PROPERTIES - a build parameters file, containing all information about the build
#
# 3) $BUILD_TYPE - the "type" of build, e.g. rpm, deb, gem, etc The jenkins url and job name
#    are obtained via the team build-data file at
#    git@github.com/puppetlabs/build-data
#
# 4) $PROJECT - the project we're building, e.g. facter, puppet. This is used later in
#    determining the target for the build artifacts on the distribution server
#
# On the Jenkins end, the job is a parameterized job that accepts four
# parameters. Jenkins has the Parameterized Trigger Plugin, Workspace Cleanup
# Plugin, and Node and Label Parameter Plugin in use for this job. The
# workspace cleanup plugin cleans the workspace before each build. Two are file
# parameters, a string parameter, and a Label parameter provided by the Node
# and Label Parameter Plugin, as described above. When th pl:jenkins:post task
# triggers a build, it passes values for all of these parameters. The Label
# parameter is associated with the build type. This way we can queue the job on
# a builder with the appropriate capabilities just by assigning a builder the
# label "deb" or "rpm," etc. The actual build itself is accomplished via a
# shell build task. The contents of the task are:

# This task allows the packaging repo to post to an arbitrary jenkins job but
# it is very limited in that it does not model well the key => value format
# used when submitting form data on websites. This is primarily because rake
# does not allow us to elegantly pass arbitrary key => value pairs on the
# command line and have any idea how to reference them inside rake. We can pass
# KEY=VALUE along with our invokation, but unless KEY is statically coded into
# our task, we won't know how to reference it. Thus, this task will only take
# one argument, the uri of the jenkins job to post to. This can be passed
# either as an argument directly or as an environment variable "JOB" with the
# uri as the value. The argument is required. The second requirement is that
# the job to be called accept a string parameter with the name SHA. This will
# be the SHA of the commit of the project source code HEAD, and should be used
# by the job to check out this specific ref. To maintain the abstraction of the
# jenkins jobs, this specific task passes on no information about the build
# itself. The assumption is that the upstream jobs know about their project,
# and so do the downstream jobs, but packaging itself has no business knowing
# about it.
