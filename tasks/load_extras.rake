# The pl:load_extras tasks is intended to load variables
# from the extra yaml file downloaded by the pl:fetch task.
# The goal is to be able to augment/override settings in the
# source project's build_data.yaml and project_data.yaml with
# Puppet Labs-specific data, rather than having to clutter the
# generic tasks with data not generally useful outside the
# PL Release team
