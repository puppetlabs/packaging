# A set of functionality for creating yum rpm repositories throughout the
# standard pkg/ directory layout that the packaging repo creates. The standard
# layout is:
# pkg/{el,fedora}/{5,6,f16,f17,f18}/{products,devel,dependencies,extras}/{i386,x86_64,SRPMS}
#
# Because we'll likely be creating the repos on a server that is remote, e.g.
# the distribution server, the logic here assumes we'll be doing everything via
# ssh commands.
