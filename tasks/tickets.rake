If there are any version dependencies expressed in the code base, make sure these are up to date. For Puppet, make sure the shas used to build the MSI are correct. For Puppet-Server, make sure all references to the puppet version are correct.

All tests (spec, acceptance) should be passing on all platforms for both stable & master.

  * If a new platform has been added, make sure that platform has acceptance testing, new features have decent coverage, etc. etc.
  * If the release is going to be cut from a sha, rather than the head of a branch, make sure that sha specifically has gone through spec/acceptance/etc. tests
  * Move all items that should be moved from Ready for CI to Ready for Review

Have all tickets been resolved (passed Functional Review)? If not please add any missing tickets to the current sprint's board.

  description[:jira_tickets_for_commit] = <<-DOC
Ensure all tickets referenced in the commit log have a bug targeted at the release

  * git log <old tag>..<new tag>
  * look through, and make sure that if there is a JIRA ticket number referenced in any of the commits, that ticket is targeted at the release
  * Also, make sure the code itself is sane, that you understand why the change was made, etc. etc.
  * [ticketmatch.rb script|https://gist.github.com/hlindberg/9520023] is a ruby script that helps with "Is there a JIRA ticket targeted at the release for every commit?" and "Is there a commit for every JIRA ticket targeted at the release?" (it beats doing it manually, but requires manual steps and hacking the script for the specific release). There is also the [release-inquisition|https://github.com/adrienthebo/release-inquisition], which also helps a lot with this task.

  description[:update_version_source] = <<-DOC
Bump VERSION in lib/{#project}/version.rb or project.clj to correct version.

  * Commit the updated version file.
    * e.g) commit -m "(packaging) Update FACTERVERSION to 1.7.3".
  * If any merging needs to happen (i.e. master into stable/stable into master), it can now happen (different subtask).
  * Once this is done, hand the SHA to be built to RelEng to be tagged.

Dependencies:
  * Is the code ready for release?
  * Is there a commit for every JIRA ticket targeted at the release?
DOC

  description[:merge_to_stable] = <<-DOC
For some releases, the code base will need to be merged down to stable.

*NOTE:* This is usually only during a x.y.0 release, but even then it may have already been done. If it doesn't apply, close this ticket.


Assuming you have origin (your remote) and upstream (puppetlabs remote), the commands will look something like this:
{noformat}
git fetch upstream
git rebase upstream/master

git checkout stable
git rebase upstream/stable

git merge master --no-ff --log
{noformat}

Once that looks good:
{noformat}
git push origin
git push upstream
{noformat}

After merging to stable, the jobs on jenkins may require updates (spec, acceptance, etc) when you merge master into stable. Please ensure that the jenkins jobs are updated if necessary.

Dependencies:
  * Is the code ready for release?
  * Is there a commit for every JIRA ticket targeted at the release?
  * Update version number in source
DOC

  description[:jira_maintenance] = <<-DOC
This happens on Jira - we need to clean up the current release and prepare for the next release.
  * Mark the version that's going out as "Released" in the Project Admin -> Versions panel.
  * Create a version we can target future issues or issues that didn't make it into the current release.  (e.g. if we're releasing Facter 1.7.4, make sure there's a 1.7.5 version (or at least 1.7.x if there's isn't another bug release planned for the near future)
  * Create a public pair of queries for inclusion in the release notes/announcement. These allow easy tracking as new bugs come in for a particular version and allow everyone to see the list of changes slated for the next release (Paste their URLs into the "Release story" ticket):
    - 'project = XX AND affectedVersion = 'X.Y.Y', Save as "Introduced in X.Y.Y", click Details, add permission for Everyone
    - 'project = XX AND fixVersion = 'X.Y.Z', Save as "Fixes for X.Y.Z", click Details, add permission for Everyone

  description[:tag_package] = <<-DOC
Tag and create packages

  * Developer provides the SHA - [~#{vars[:developer]}] - Please add the SHA as a comment (this should be the commit which contains the newly updated version.rb)
  * checkout the sha
    * Make sure you are about to tag the correct thing
  * Create the tag e.g.) git tag -s -u {GPG key} -m "1.7.3" 1.7.3
    * You need to know the pass phrase for this to complete successfully. It's important that we make sure all releases are signed to verify authenticity.
    * DO NOT push the tag to the repo, keep it local only
  * `git describe` will show you the tag. Make sure you're building what you think you're building.
  * Make sure you look over the code that has changed since the previous release so we know what's going out the door.
  * run `rake package:implode package:bootstrap pl:jenkins:uber_build` when you've verified what version you're building (this uses the latest version of the packaging repo to build the packages).
  * If this is a puppet release, you have to build the windows msi. This is done using jenkins jobs on jenkins-legacy. You have to make sure you're targeting the correct versions of hiera, facter and puppet.
  * [~#{vars[:builder]}] please add a comment with location of packages.

For puppet, don't forget the msi packages. This usually comes after other smoke testing is going well since it does require the tag to be pushed live.

Dependencies:
  * Every ticket before this except for release notes.
DOC

  description[:smoke_test] = <<-DOC
Procedure may vary by project and point in the release cycle. Ask around.

In general this should happen on a variety of platforms, i.e. one or two each of kind of package we create (i.e., gem, dmg, msi, deb, rpm, etc).

For Puppet, our acceptance suite now tests service scripts, and on debian, a passenger master.  Manual smoke testing can therefore be limited to other package formats than deb and rpm.

Lighter testing of Z releases is acceptable.

  * Add a link to the Packages repository that you receive from the "Tag and create packages" subtask
  * Ping folks on your team for help with different platforms.
  * When you pick up a platform, please leave a comment below that you are testing it. When it looks good, leave another comment, preferably with a code snippet showing the commands executed and their output.
  * When all platforms picked have been smoke tested, move this ticket to done.

IMPORTANT: Please edit the description of this ticket and remove "Example:" below. Edit the platforms to smoke test on, and the smoke test procedure.

Example:
Smoke test platforms:
  * pick some platforms such as
  * Windows 2003/2008/2012 (msi)
  * Solaris 10/11 (tarball or gem?)
  * OSX (dmg)
  * (Note if you are smoke testing Puppet and pick an rpm or deb based platform, concentrate on testing a gem or tarball, since acceptance should have adequately smoke tested those packages.)
    * RHEL/CentOS 5/6/7
    * Fedora 19/20
    * Debian 6/7
    * Ubuntu 10.04/12.04/14.04

Smoke test procedure:
  * Start/stop/restart a master (if the platform supports that)
  * Start/stop/restart an agent
  * Help/man
  * Write and run some manifests

Dependencies:
  * Tag and create packages
  * For Windows MSIs - Push tag

This should happen Monday-Thursday, before 4pm. We should not be shipping anything after 4:00 PM or on a Friday both for our users, and because shipping takes time.

Get a yes/no for the release from dev, docs, product, qa, releng.

This meeting is informal, over chat, and usually happens right before packages are pushed.
Keep in mind we typically do not ship releases in the evening and we don't ship on Friday if the release is a final release.

DOC

  description[:push_packages] = <<-DOC
Push packages
  * run `rake pl:jenkins:uber_ship`
    * You will need the keys to the castle (aka the passphrase) for this to work.
    * Don't forget to make sure everything looks like it's in the correct folder, the pkgs dir has been cleared out, and that you are shipping for all expected platforms.
    * Get a *second set of RelEng eyes* on the packages that are about to be shipped to make sure everything looks a-okay.
    * If you're shipping a gem you need to make sure you have a rubygems account, are an owner of that project, and have a gem config file.
    * If you're shipping puppet you need to sign the MSI file for Windows. This is a manual process and the ship task doesn't ship or build the msi so talk to Moses or Haus for more details. This file also needs to be manually signed.

Dependencies:
  * Go / No Go meeting (Status - Ship it!)

When working through this ticket, add it to the board and then keep it in the Ready for Engineering column.
Move the subtasks to In Progress when you are working on them and Resolved when you have completed them.
In general subtasks should only be moved to Ready for Engineering when they are ready to be worked on. For some assignees this is their cue to start working on release-related items.

 * The first set of tickets are assigned to the developer, those can all be converted to Ready for Engineering and you can start working through them.
 * Only when those are done should you move the "Prepare notes" and "Tag release/create packages" tasks to Ready for Engineering. Ping those assigned to move forward.
 * When you hear back for "Tag Release/create packages", you should move "Smoke test packages" to Ready for Engineering or In Progress if you are ready.

The BUILDER/DEVELOPER/WRITER params must be valid jira usernames.

The RELEASE param is a freeform string, no validation is done against it.

The DATE param is a predicted date that this release ticket will be started. This
  is a hint to Release Engineering about when to prep for the release, but not a
  binding contract to release on that date.

The PROJECT param must be a valid jira project name; tickets will be created in this project.

The JIRA_USER parameter is used to login to jira to create the tickets. You will
