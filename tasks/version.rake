# This is something of a work in progress. Unfortunately,
# many of the projects that use the packaging repo carry
# version files with hard-coded versions, and many of these
# are in completely disparate formats.
#
# This task attempts to automate the updating of this file
# with the version to be packaged, but given the many version
# file formats in use, doing so cleanly is difficult. With
# any luck, going forward some of these projects will move
# away from maintaining hard-coded versions in source.
# However, if this effort loses momentum, we may end up
# revisiting this task and improving it substantially,
# and/or standardizing the expected version file format.
