# Modify existing Rake tasks with behavior to support managed builds Use
# monkey-patched #unshift method and existing #enhance method to enable
# inserting actions into already defined rake tasks on the fly.

# For core tasks (e.g. pl:deb, package:tar, etc) we use #enhance to add an
# additional execution block after the existing tasks, containing a status post
# to the build server. Each individual task (e.g. deb cow build) has to post a
# status, which is why we're adding at this level.

# For aggregate-style tasks, e.g. "pl:deb_all" we prepend to the existing
# execution blocks with one which notifies the build manager that a build has
# started. This means that only these specific tasks we're working with here
# are capable of this.
